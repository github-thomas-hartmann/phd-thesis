# Structural Issues - Disconnected Concept Clusters:
# Checking the connectivity of the graph, it is possible to identify all weakly connected
# components. These data sets form islands in the vocabulary and might be
# caused by incomplete data acquisition, forgotten test data, out-dated terms and the like.
# Implementation: Creation of an undirected graph that includes all non-
# orphan concepts as nodes and all semantic relations as edges. Tarjanâ€™s
# algorithm then finds and returns all weakly connected components.
