# SKOS-C-LABELING-AND-DOCUMENTATION-02
# -----
# Labeling and Documentation Issues - Overlapping Labels:
# This is a generalization of a recommendation in the SKOS primer,
# that no two concepts have the same preferred lexical label in a given
# language when they belong to the same concept scheme. This could indicate
# missing disambiguation information and thus lead to problems in auto-completion application.
