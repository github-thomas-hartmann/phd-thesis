# Labeling and Documentation Issues - Incomplete Language Coverage:
# Some concepts in a thesaurus are labeled in only one language, 
# some in multiple languages. It may be desirable to have each concept
# labeled in each of the languages that also are used on the other concepts.
# This is not always possible, but incompleteness of language coverage for some
# concepts can indicate shortcomings of the vocabulary.
