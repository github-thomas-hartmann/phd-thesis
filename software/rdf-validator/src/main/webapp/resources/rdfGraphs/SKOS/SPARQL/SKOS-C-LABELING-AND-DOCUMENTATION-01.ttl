# Labeling and Documentation Issues - Undocumented Concepts:
# The SKOS standard defines a number of properties useful for
# documenting the meaning of the concepts in a thesaurus also in a human-
# readable form. Intense use of these properties leads to a well-documented
# thesaurus which should also improve its quality. 
# Implementation: Iteration over all concepts
# in the vocabulary and find those not using one of skos:note, skos:changeNote,
# skos:definition, skos:editorialNote, skos:example, skos:historyNote, or skos:scopeNote.
