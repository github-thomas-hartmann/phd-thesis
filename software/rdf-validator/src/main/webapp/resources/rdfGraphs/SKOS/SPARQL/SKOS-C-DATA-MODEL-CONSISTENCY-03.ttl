# Labeling and Documentation Issues - Mapping Relations Misuse: 
# According to the SKOS reference documentation, mapping relations
# (e.g., skos:broadMatch or skos:relatedMatch) should be asserted to concepts
# being members of different concept schemes. This check finds concepts that
# are related by a mapping property and are either members of the same
# concept scheme or members of no concept scheme at all.
