# SKOS-C-STRUCTURE-01
# -----
# Structural Issues - Orphan Concepts:
# An orphan concept is a concept without any associative or hierarchical relations. It might have
# attached literals like e.g., labels, but is not connected to any other resource,
# lacking valuable context information. A controlled vocabulary that contains
# many orphan concepts is less usable for search and retrieval use cases, 
# because, e.g., no hierarchical query expansion can be performed on search terms
# to find documents with more general content.
# Implementation: Iteration over all concepts in the vocabulary and re-
# turning that donâ€™t have associated resources using (sub-properties of) skos:semanticRelation.
