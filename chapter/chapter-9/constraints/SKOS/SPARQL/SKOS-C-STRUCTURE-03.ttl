# SKOS-C-STRUCTURE-03
# -----
# Structural Issues - Cyclic Hierarchical Relations:
# Although perfectly consistent with the SKOS data model, cyclic relations may reveal
# a logical problem in the thesaurus. Consider the following example: 
# decision --> problem resolution --> problem --> decision: here the cycle is
# closed). The concepts are connected using skos:broader relationships
# (indicated with -->). Due to the fact that a thesaurus is in many cases a product
# of consensus between the contributors (or just the decision of one dedicated
# thesaurus manager), it will be almost impossible to automatically resolve
# the cycle (i.e. deleting an edge).
# Implementation: Construction of a graph having all concepts as nodes
# and the set of edges being skos:broader relations.
