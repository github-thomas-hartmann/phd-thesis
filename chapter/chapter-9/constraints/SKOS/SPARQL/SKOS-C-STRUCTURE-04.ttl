# SKOS-C-STRUCTURE-04
# -----
# Structural Issues - Valueless Associative Relations:
# Two concepts are sibling, but also connected by an associative relation. 
# In that context, the associative relation is not necessary. See ISO DIS 25964-1, 11.3.2.2
# Implementation: Identification of all pairs of concepts that have the same
# broader or narrower concepts, i.e. they are sibling terms. All siblings
# that are related by a skos:related property are returned.
